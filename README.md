# object-detection-using-yolov5

## Problem Statment
Build a simple object detection model using pre-trained models, detect and label objects in the video frames and display the bounding boxes with class labels and confidence scores

## Requirements 
1. Download yolov5 form their github repository
2. Haveing a Nvidia GPU capable of running cuda
3. A working camera or webcam connected to the computer

## Steps to run the Program
1. Run the code.py 
2. Enter the no of seconds you want the video capture to run and the source of camera or webcam
3. Once the code is finished it will generate a file named cam.mp4
4. Open the vedio file or run the file vid_runner.py to play the video
